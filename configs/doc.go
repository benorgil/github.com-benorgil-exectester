# Initial config

I want to consolidate things like logger initialization and build/test
config in a single place. While Viper is used for config handling of the
cli app itself the config here needs to be initialized before the Cobra
app itself- so I don't think I can use Viper here.

# Logging config

# TODO IM HERE document

# Build config

This is a little gnarly and kind of an experiment. Using Dagger we can ref
this actual project's code from inside the build scripts. Doing this
excessively would make a mess, but I think its worth leveraging judiciously.
