// # What is it?
//
// A tool to send arbitrary text to stdout or
// stderr and set the exit code
//
// # Project structure
//
// This is a Cobra app thats lives in the "cmd" package/subfolder: [cmd]
//
// For build automation there is a Dagger pipeline in the
// [github.com/benorgil/exectester/build_pipeline] folder.
//
// # Usage
//
// For the actual cli tool usage just use the help menu, it includes a
// bunch of full examples:
//	et --help
//
// This is a console app not a package so having "examples"
// ([cmd.PkgExamples]) for the internal functions is pretty
// unnecessary, but...
//	- I'm looking for an excuse to get familiar with GoDoc!
//	- I'm using/abusing the example snippets that shell out to call the
//    compiled app to double for "integration" tests
//	- Might still be useful to have playground examples for calling the
//    root command?
//	- I created this useless list to try the new GoDoc list support!
