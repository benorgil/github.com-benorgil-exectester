# Cmd package

This is a mostly standard Cobra + Viper app created with the default
templates:

  - `go mod init exectester`
  - `cobra-cli init`

There are no subcommands just the root command.

The root cobra Command ([github.com/spf13/cobra.Command]) is wrapped
in a function ([cmd.RootCmd]) to make it testable. It calls another
function ([cmd.ExecTester]) where the entire app's functionality is
defined.

# Custom type flags

These are are Cobra flags built from a custom type.

  - [cmd.outputFormatterEnum]
  - [cmd.interpolatorEnum]

It takes an obnoxious amount of scaffolding to get Cobra + Viper to
support flags from custom types.
